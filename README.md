# Movie-Recommendation-Engine

### Introduction
Developing a movie recommendation engine to enhance user experience on a movie streaming platform. The goal was to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and viewing history. By leveraging machine learning techniques, I aimed to reduce the time users spend searching for movies and increase their engagement on the platform.

### Task:
The objective of the project was to build a movie recommendation engine that could suggest relevant movies to users based on their preferences.

### Prepare:
I began by importing the necessary libraries and loading the movie dataset, which consisted of movie details and credits. The dataset was cleaned, irrelevant columns were dropped, and text-based columns were transformed for analysis. 

### Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Generation
3. Similarity Calculation
4. Recommendation Function
5. Performance Evaluation

### Result:
The movie recommendation engine significantly improved the user experience on the streaming platform:

1. **Reduced Search Time:** Users spent less time searching for movies, leading to higher user engagement.
2. **Personalization:** The engine provides personalized recommendations, catering to individual preferences.
3. **Discoverability:** Users were introduced to movies they might not have otherwise considered.
